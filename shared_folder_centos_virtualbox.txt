# The VirtualBox documentation[1] for how to install guest additions 
# for Linux on a virtual host is somewhat messy. So here is what 
# I did to make it work.

# Install the packages required
yum update
yum install gcc kernel-devel make

reboot

# Click: Devices/Install Guest Additions... 

# Mount the ISO image with the guest additions
mkdir /cdrom
mount /dev/cdrom /cdrom

# Install guest additions
/cdrom/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run

# Share a folder from the VirtualBox control panel, giving it a share name.

# Mount the share
mkdir /a_folder_name 
mount -t vboxsf the_share_name /a_folder_name
