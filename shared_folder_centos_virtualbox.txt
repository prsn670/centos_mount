The VirtualBox documentation[1] for how to install guest additions for Linux on a virtual host is somewhat messy. So here is what I did to make it work.

yum update
yum install gcc kernel-devel make

reboot

mkdir /cdrom
mount /dev/cdrom /cdrom
/cdrom/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run

Share a folder from the VirtualBox control panel, giving it a share name.

mkdir /a_folder_name 

mount -t vboxsf the_share_name /a_folder_name
